# Home Router

This is a set of setup scripts for my OpenWrt based router. It's customised for
my own needs and might not be suitable for everyone. What it has

- My specific hardware setup
- Split wifi setup for IoT/Homelab
- Split networking for main/IoT/Homelab
- Promstack observability scripting for everything
- Loki logs exporter
- Ad blocker and firehol IP blocker

**WARNING**: those are mostly just a backup for my own setup with hard coded IP
addresses. Don't expect it to work as a polished automated install. Check what
you're copypasting.
